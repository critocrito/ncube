A workspace is a collection of [sources](https://sugarcubetools.net/ncube/glossary#source), [data](https://sugarcubetools.net/ncube/glossary#data) and [investigations](https://sugarcubetools.net/ncube/glossary#investigation). All your work takes place within one workspace. Data collected in one workspace is not visible in another. Local workspaces are stored on your local computer and entirely belong to you. Remote workspaces are stored on a server and can be shared with multiple people.

You can read more about workspaces on the [Sugarcube tools website](https://sugarcubetools.net/ncube/glossary#workspace).
