#### Search Grammar

The simplest for of search is to simply search for a term.

```
  hospital
```

This query searches for any unit of data that matches the term `hospital`. Terms can be compounded.

```
  hospital attack
```

The above search will look for data that matches either the words `hospital` _or_ `attack`.

```
  "hospital attack"
```

Additionaly to the term based search, units can be queried using keyword selectors.

```
  source:youtube_video
```

The above selector limits the search scope to all units of type `youtube_video`.

Another keyword selector allows to limit the search scope to units that contain a certain tag.

```
  tag:aleppo
```

Tag labels are normalized to lower case. Tags that consist of more than one workd can be enclosed in quotes.

```
  tag:"mf001a greg"
```

`mf001a greg` is the label of a single tag.
