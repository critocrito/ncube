Before you can start to preserve, explore and verify any data, you have to create a workspace. You can start with creating a _local workspace_ by clicking the button below. To link to a _remote workspace_ you require the connection details provided to you by the operator of the remote Ncube installation.

To get started with Ncube, head over to the [tutorial](https://sugarcubetools.net/ncube/tutorial). It will walk you through a small example data investigation and introduce you to the different functionalities of Ncube.

To get help about Ncube and data investigation methodologies, or to suggest new use cases and functionality, feel free to post on the [Sugarcube Tools community forum](https://users.sugarcubetools.net). Ncube is an imperfect software in an imperfect world.

If you found that something wasn't working the way you expected it, please report it on the [Ncube issue tracker](https://github.com/critocrito/ncube/issues).
